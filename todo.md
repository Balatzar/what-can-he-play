# todo

- create a cron task to get new cards from api.hearthstonejson.com
- add error handling
- handle no playable card
- give info about a card

## graphical interface

- allow to choose more card class (ex thief card stealer)
- add other types of cards (ex creatures with provoc or damage dealt effects, or weapons)
- add previous costs (ex even if a player has 5 mana we want to highlight 5 cost cards, but also show lower costs)
- allow people to submit cards *importance* to highlight them. Also combos (when this class has X mana it can play this insane combo)
